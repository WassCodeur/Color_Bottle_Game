## Color Bottle Game

Implement a Solidity algorithm for a color bottle arrangement game. The game:

Has 5 bottles of different colors in a sequence

Allows players 5 attempts to arrange bottles correctly

Informs players of correct arrangements after each attempt

Randomly shuffles bottles after 5 attempts

Prevents players from continuing if they win; requires a new game.

Takes player's attempted arrangement as input (5 integers: 1-5)

Returns number of correct arrangements

Use keccak256 and uint256 for random number generation.
